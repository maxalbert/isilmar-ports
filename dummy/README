This is a dummy (non-functional) port. Its only purpose is that it
provides a minimal Makefile for easy copying & pasting to create a
port for a software package that can be compiled with the standard

   configure; make; make install

incantation (although obviously the port name, download URL and version
need to be adapted). It can also serve as a convenient starting point
for packages which require more complicated installation procedures.
