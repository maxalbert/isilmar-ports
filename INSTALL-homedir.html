<h1>Installing isilmar-ports in your home directory</h1>
<p>
The isilmar ports collection can also be used to install software
completely in user land, without ever needing increased privileges.
This page describes such a user-land installation.
</p>

<h2>Choosing your directory layout</h2>
<p>
Isilmar-ports take the directory layout they follow from environment
variables, so you better set them once and for all. Also, to make your
installation useful, you have to add the place you install to into
your path.
</p>
<p>
In the following copy-and-paste example we assume that your shell is
the bash (the most popular one on GNU/Linux systems) and use the
following layout. Everything we do (apart from setting these
environment variables) happens in a directory <tt>software</tt> in
your home directory. In that directory, we have a
directory <tt>install</tt> where everything is installed into, a
directory <tt>distfiles</tt> where upstream sources are collected and
a directory <tt>ports</tt> for the ports tree. Hence you might add the
following to your <tt>.bashrc</tt>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
export PORTSDIR=$HOME/software/ports
export DISTDIR=$HOME/software/distfiles
export PREFIXBASE=$HOME/software/install
export PATH=$PREFIXBASE/bin:$PATH
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Don't forget to source the configuration again, to have these
variables set (for fresh shells this will happen automatically once
you've changed your configuration file).
</p>
<blockquote>
$ . ~/.bashrc
</blockquote>

<h2>Bootstrapping stow and cvs</h2>
<p>
The isilmar ports use stow(1) as packaging tool and the usual way to
get a your ports tree is to do a checkout of a local copy of the
ports cvs repository. So stow(1) and cvs(1) are needed; fortunately,
they are both provided by the ports tree. However, that means that the
first installation is slightly different, to avoid the chicken-egg
problem.
</p>
<p><i>Note:</i>All files hosted on <tt>https://www.linta.de/ports</tt>
are also hosted on <tt>http://www.linta.de/ports</tt>, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Get your ports tree as shell archive.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ mkdir -p $PORTSDIR
$ cd $PORTSDIR
$ wget https://www.linta.de/ports/ports.shar
$ /bin/sh ports.shar
$ rm ports.shar
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then install the port stow by hand.
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ cd $PORTSDIR/stow && make install clean
$ cd $PREFIXBASE/stow
$ ./stow-*/bin/stow stow-*/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then the port cvs can be installed in the usual way.
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ $PORTSDIR/bin/reinstallport cvs
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Obtaining the ports repository</h2>
<p>
Now it is time to replace the bootstrap ports tree by a proper cvs
checkout. In that way, you have full history and can also choose to
use older versions.
</p>
<p>First remove the bootstrap ports tree</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ rm -rf $PORTSDIR
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then download the cvs repository. In our example we place it in
software/isilmar in your home directory; any other place works equally
well, so adapt to your needs.
</p> 
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ mkdir -p $HOME/software/isilmar
$ cd $HOME/software/isilmar
$ wget https://www.linta.de/ports/ports.cvs.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz ports.cvs.tar.gz 
$ rm ports.cvs.tar.gz
$ CVSROOT=`pwd`/ports.cvs
$ cd $HOME/software # the parent of $PORTSDIR
$ cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout ports
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now you can walk around in $PORTSDIR and use the usual cvs commands,
like log or update to learn about the history of a port or get an
older version.
</p>

<h2>Installing Software</h2>

That's it! Now $PORTDIR/bin/reinstallport is the tool to install or
upgrade a port. It takes precisely one argument, the name of the port.
E.g., if you want to install units, simply type
<blockquote>
<pre>
$PORTSDIR/bin/reinstallport units
</pre>
</blockquote>
