Note:

After reinstalling wsgitools you have to restart all
applications using them. On current isilmar installation
carrying out the following commands will do.

sv force-reload df-alt-adapter
/etc/init.d/http2tcp-server restart
/etc/init.d/dyndns-scgi-server restart
sv force-reload brodoaidpd
/etc/init.d/nagiossubmit restart
/etc/init.d/dokuforge2 restart
